# Biography

David LeBauer is a research scientist at the University of Illinois and a Fellow with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. His research focuses on the development and management of efficient and sustainable ecosystems using scientific understanding of how crops and ecosystems work combined with observations. His work uses mechanistic models to interpret data from field measurements and remote sensing platforms to characterize and predict the response of ecosystems to different crops and management strategies. To support this work, he has led development of an informatics and computing pipeline for high-throughput crop phenotyping (TERRAREF, terraref.org) a database used for agronomic and ecological decision support (BETYdb, betydb.org), software to manage crop and ecosystem modeling workflows (PEcAn, pecanproject.org) and the BioCro crop productivity model. He is also a Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry instructor helping to promote computational and data literacy among scientists.
